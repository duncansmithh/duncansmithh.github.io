                <strong>Personal Background: </strong>
                I was born in San Francisco, CA. 
                My family moved to Chicago when I was 1 years old, then to New Jersey when I was 8, and finally to North Carolina when I was 14. 
                Iâ€™ve loved gaming since I was a kid playing pokemon on my DS in 1st grade. 
                This led to me getting interested in computers and eventually going to major in computer science for college.
