        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Good: <a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/">Mercedes-Benz</a></h3>
            <p>This website is very stylistic, but still demonstrates good use of the CRAP principles of design. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contrast: </strong>
                    This website has good contrast, as it uses blurring in order to draw attention to the important images and links. 
                    The text is also very easy to read, with a good contrast between the text and the background.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Repetition: </strong>
                    The repetition on this site is subtle, but is well defined and effective. 
                    The main page is a stylistic slideshow type paeg, with repeting windows containing pictures and videos. 
                    It is all implemented very smoothly, with each section using the same fonts, style choices, and visual motifs.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alignment: </strong>
                    The alignment on this site is very good. 
                    Even though the design isn't very typical, everything is very well organized and easy to read. 
                    The text segments are aligned with the images pertaining to each section, and the text is aligned to the left.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Proximity: </strong>
                    The proximity on this site is excellent. 
                    Every section that draws your attention is very well spaced, each having room to stand out. 
                    The text is also very well spaced, having good font sizes, and not being cramped and hard to read.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Bad: <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/ushome/index.html">Daily Mail</a></h3>
            <p>This website is one that showcases bad examples of the CRAP principles of design. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contrast: </strong>
                    The contrast on this site isn't very good. 
                    In particular, the sizes of the text and images are very inconsistent, making it hard to tell what is important and what isn't.
                    The text is also hard to read, with the font being very small and it all looking the same as the other elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Repetition: </strong>
                    The repetition on this site isn't terrible, but that doesn't do it any favors due to the clutter of all the content. 
                    Even the list of categories at the top isn't that helpful with having seemingly random categories and no clear organization.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alignment: </strong>
                    The alignment is probably the only thing this website has going for it. 
                    All the text is left aligned which is a positive, and images are all aligned with the text pertaining to them. 
                    The only issue is that the content is occaisonally misaligned due to more important section dominating the screenspace.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Proximity: </strong>
                    The proximity on Daily Mail is extremely poor, with the site being very cluttered and hard to seperate. 
                    All the text and images on the page are packed into one large wall of media, making it harder than it should be to decipher.
                    The sizes of side emelents are consistantly on par with the main content, making it hard to tell what is important and what isn't.
