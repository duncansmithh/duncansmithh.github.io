            <p>
                My name is Duncan Smith, and I am a student at UNC Charlotte. 
                I am a Computer Science major, pursuing a concentration in cybersecurity. 
                I live in from Weddington, North Carolina, but I've lived all over. 
                I enjoy playing video games, reading, and spending time with my friends and family.
                Most of all, I have a passion for fitness and health, and I enjoy working out and staying active. 
                I've been working out for a few years now, and I've learned a lot about fitness and health along the way.

            <h2>What</h2>
            <h3>About my Hobby</h3>
            <p>
                My hobby is fitness and health.  
                I mainly focus on weightlifting and strength training, but recently I've been getting more into different types of cardio. 
                While lifting is important, I also enjoy learning about nutrition and how to fuel my body properly. 
                Health and nutrition is a large part of fitness, as without the proper care and fuel, you'd just be limiting yourself. 
                I believe that everyone should be active you're doing yourself a diservice if you don't care for your physical well-being.

                This is a photo of some weights, which are a key part of my fitness routine. 
                Weights are my favorite part of working out, as I enjoy the simplicity of it. 
                There is something therapudic and calming about lifting weights, 
                which helps me decompress and focus on my self, almost as some form of meditation.

            <p>
                I try to workout 5-6 days a week.
                Even though I don't always hit this goal, I try to make sure I'm active every day, whether it's going for a walk or doing some bodyweight exercises.  
                For my workout routine, my favorite at the moment is a simple push pull legs split throughout the week. 
                Starting on Monday with push, then pull on Tuesday, and legs on Wednesday, then repeating the cycle, resting on Sunday. 
                Tyipically I'm at the gym for anywhere from an hour to two hours, depending on the day and how I'm feeling.

                It's also important to note that consistency is key, so I'm working out year round. 
                I've worked out in all seasons, from the hot summer days to the cold winter nights.

                I've worked out in some pretty interesting places, from working out in the woods while camping, to doing makeshift lifts on the beach, I've always found a way to get active.
                Over the years I've learned that you can work out anywhere, as with the right mindset and motivation, you can make anything work.

                Nutrition is the part of fitness that I've struggled with the most, but slowly I've been getting better at it. 
                I've learned that meal prepping is the best way to stay on track with my diet, as it helps me stay consistent and not make bad choices. 
                While I don't always meal prep, I try to do it at least once a week, making enough food to last me a few days. 
                My favorite meals to prep are burritos, as they're easy to make and can be customized to fit however I'm feeling that week.

            <p>
                I've haven't always always been an active person, as when I was younger I was overweight and didn't know better as to care for my health. 
                I was never really taught or encouraged to be healthy by my parents or friends, which led to a slew of bad habits. 
                Since realizing what I was doing to myself, I've made a conscious effort to change my lifestyle and become a healthier person. 
                I've decided I want to become the best version of myself both physically and mentally, and I believe that starts with the body, 
                as our mind feeds off our diet and physical health.

                and as long as you stay consitent through the years, you'll get to where you want to be.
